    question: "Is setup hard?",
    answer: "No â€” connect in minutes. No switching tools needed. We use secure OAuth to read your invoices, and you'll be up and running in under 5 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I approve messages before they go out?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You choose auto-send or approve mode. You have complete control over every message before it reaches your customers."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my accounting data safe?",
    answer: "Yes. We use secure, read-only OAuth connections and SOC 2-ready practices. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and we never have write access to your accounting system."
